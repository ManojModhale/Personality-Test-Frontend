Big 5 Personality Test
The Big 5 Personality Test is an online tool that allows users to evaluate their personality based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM). The test measures five key personality traits:

Openness
Conscientiousness
Extraversion
Agreeableness
Neuroticism
This repository contains the frontend built with Angular, featuring a user-friendly interface that guides users through the test and displays the results. The test questions and images are fetched from local JSON files, and the app uses various services to manage test timing, fetching questions, and sending user responses to the backend.

Features
Interactive Test: Answer questions to evaluate each of the five personality traits.
Real-time Results: After completing the test, users receive a detailed analysis of their personality.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
User Authentication: Login, registration, and profile management features.
Visual Results: Graphical representation of scores for each personality trait.
Service Integration: Services for counting exam time, fetching questions, submitting answers, and interacting with the backend.
Technologies Used
Angular: Framework for building dynamic single-page web applications.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
Bootstrap: For responsive layout.
RxJS: For handling asynchronous operations and data streams.
Chart.js (Optional): For visualizing results in graphical format.

Folder Description
src/app/components/: Contains components for different pages like the homepage, login, registration, dashboard, etc.
src/app/services/: Contains services to handle the logic of exam timing, fetching questions, submitting answers, and communicating with the backend.
src/assets/: Contains static assets like images and JSON files that hold the test questions.
src/app/models/: Defines TypeScript interfaces and models used throughout the application (e.g., User, Question).
How It Works
Test Questions: The questions for the test are stored in a JSON file located in the assets folder. These are dynamically loaded and displayed in the test pages.
Services: Services such as exam-time.service.ts, get-test.service.ts, and send-answer.service.ts manage the test's logic, including timing, fetching questions, and sending responses to the backend for analysis.
User Interface: The components in the components/ folder render the various pages of the app, such as the homepage, test interface, and results dashboard.
